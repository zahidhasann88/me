            From architecting scalable backend systems to crafting pixel-perfect frontends, I thrive at the intersection of logic 
            and creativity. I specialize in building performant web applications, applying modern engineering principles, clean code 
            practices, and automation to solve real-world problems. Whether it's designing robust APIs or optimizing client-side 
            performance, I ensure every layer of the stack works in harmony.

            My experience spans more than just development. I collaborate closely with product teams to understand the "why" behind 
            the features we build. With a strong eye for system design and user needs, I help translate complex business requirements 
            into reliable, maintainable software. I'm passionate about building products that are intuitive, scalable, and genuinely 
            useful.

          <p>
            Technology is at the core of everything I build. I stay curious and continually explore new stacks, libraries, and 
            architectures â€” from frontend frameworks like Angular and React to backend platforms like Node.js, Go, and PostgreSQL. 
            I believe in choosing the right tools for the job, balancing innovation with reliability, and always optimizing for 
            maintainability and performance.

            A journey sparked by curiosity and fueled by consistent learning. I took the unconventional path, teaching myself how to

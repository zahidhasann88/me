      Hey there! I'm Zahid, a software engineer who loves turning complex problems into elegant solutions. 
      When I'm not deep in code, you'll find me exploring new technologies, reading about system design, 
      or probably debugging something that "worked fine yesterday." I believe great software is built by 
      people who care about both the technical craft and the humans who use it.

            I build scalable web applications with clean, maintainable code. My sweet spot is full-stack development 
            where I can work on everything from database design to user interfaces. I'm passionate about writing 
            code that's not just functional, but also readable and efficient. Whether it's optimizing API performance 
            or crafting smooth user experiences, I love the challenge of making complex systems feel simple.

            I believe the best products come from understanding real problems. I work closely with teams to bridge 
            the gap between "what users need" and "what's technically possible." My approach involves asking lots 
            of questions, prototyping quickly, and iterating based on feedback. I've learned that good product 
            development is as much about knowing what NOT to build as it is about building the right things.

          <p>
            Every bug is a puzzle, every feature is an opportunity to make someone's day better. I approach problems 
            methodicallyâ€”breaking them down, understanding the root cause, and finding solutions that are sustainable. 
            I'm that person who actually enjoys debugging sessions and finds satisfaction in refactoring messy code 
            into something beautiful. Sometimes the best solution is the simplest one.

            Started my coding journey with a simple HTML page and thought I was a wizard when I made text change colors. 
            Those late nights learning JavaScript fundamentals, struggling with CSS layouts, and the pure joy of seeing 
            my first dynamic web page workâ€”that's when I knew I found my calling. Every error message was a lesson, 
            and every working feature felt like magic.

            This is when things got serious. Started building actual applications that people could use, not just 
            tutorial projects. Learned about databases, APIs, authentication, and all the "boring" stuff that makes 
            applications actually work in the real world. Also discovered that deployment is an art form and that 
            "it works on my machine" is not a valid argument.

            Started thinking beyond individual features to entire systems. Learned about microservices, database 
            optimization, caching strategies, and how to design systems that don't fall over when more than 10 people 
            use them. Discovered that premature optimization is real, but so is the pain of rebuilding everything 
            when you didn't plan for growth.

            I'm a curious person by nature. I love reading about technology trends, watching YouTube videos about 
            random engineering topics, and occasionally attempting to cook something more complex than instant noodles 
            (with mixed results). I also enjoy long walks where I inevitably end up thinking about code architecture 
            or that bug I couldn't fix earlier.

            I believe in writing code like someone else has to maintain it (because they probably will). 
            I think the best solutions are often the simplest ones, and that good software should feel invisible 
            to the user. I also believe in the power of good documentation, meaningful commit messages, and that 
            code reviews are opportunities to learn, not battles to win.

            I specialize in building that foundationâ€”developing APIs that manage data efficiently, designing scalable 
            database architectures, and ensuring systems remain reliable as they grow. While I thrive behind the scenes, 
            I also step into frontend development to bridge the gap and deliver cohesive user experiences. Writing clean, 
            maintainable code is a priority because I believe software should be intuitive to understand and easy to evolve. 
            I enjoy breaking down complex problems and turning them into practical, high-performing solutions. For me, 
            engineering is about balancing precision and pragmatism to build tools that work â€” reliably and quietly.`,

            on asking thoughtful questions, prototyping early, and iterating based on feedback. Over time, I've learned that
